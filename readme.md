#  my-website

## Description
This is my static site hosted on github pages. It contains my portfolio, my projects and my blog.

## Details
I use jekyll to build this using templates and markdown. There is no automatic process so I have to build my jekyll project and then just copy
paste the _site folder over to this repo. I could probably automate it, but it's fine for now.
